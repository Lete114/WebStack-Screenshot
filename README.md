## ðŸ“¸ Website Screenshot

You need to configure an environment variable name `WEBSTACK_SCREENSHOT_SERVERLESS`, and the value of the environment variable can be any value you want, e.g. `true`.

You may need to manually configure font files if the intercepted site contains text in other languages.

Configure the environment variable name `WEBSTACK_SCREENSHOT_FONTS`, the environment variable value can be a url or a path, multiple font files need to be split by `,`. url address must be `https://`, path must be an `absolute` path.

e.g. `/var/task/fonts/xxx.ttf,https://xxxxx/xxx/xxx.ttf`
